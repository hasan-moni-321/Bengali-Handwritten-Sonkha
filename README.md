 ## Bengali-Handwritten-Sonkha
 
 ### About Dataset
 This is a classification project! Where I used Bengali handwritten Sonkha(means: Number of Bengali Language) dataset. Dataset have more than two hundred thousands 
 train images and more than seventeen thousands test images.Ten different classes of the images. Every image size is 32, 32 
 
 ### Bengali Sonkha Tensorflow
 In this project I used end-to-end opensource platform Tensorflow. For Data preprocessing I used cv2 for example GaussianBlur, AddWeight and alos added some kernel           to the image to get specific color of images to train properly.                                                                                                      
 I have built convolutional neural network model, because it is the image classification. I took 20% validation data from the train dataset. In this model I used Adam optimizer where learing rate is "1e-3"

 ## Bengali-Handwritten-Sonkha
 
 ### About Dataset
 This is a classification project! Where I used Bengali handwritten Sonkha(means: Number of Bengali Language) dataset. Dataset have more than two hundred thousands 
 train images and more than seventeen thousands test images.
 
  ### Bengali Sonkha Tensorflow
  In this project I used end-to-end opensource platform Tensorflow. For Data preprocessing I used cv2 for example GaussianBlur, AddWeight and alos added some kernel to the image
  to get specific color of images to train properly.
